# scheduling-system-with-round-robin-algorithm
In Java

– Developed a scheduling system in Java to allocate multiple tasks arriving asynchronously to a
ready/waiting queue and monitor arriving and leaving tasks using multithreading.

– Implemented a receiver thread to receive and put new tasks into a proper queue.

– Implemented a scheduler thread to imitate CPU scheduler using round-robin algorithm.
